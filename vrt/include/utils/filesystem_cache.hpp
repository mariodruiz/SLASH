/**
 * @brief Static class for managing the filesystem cache - i.e. where trivial temporary files can be stored.
 *
 * There are two directories with different pourposes:
 * 1. Runtime directory, generally stored as tmpfs on Linux (in RAM). Locks or really small files go here.
 * 2. Cache directory, generally stored on disk.
 *
 * For more information see: https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/0.8/
 *
 * SLASH uses subdirectories within each of the main directories, and vrt uses a subdirectory within the SLASH
 * directory.
 *
 * See each function for a description of paths used and what enviornment variables to set to override these choices.
 * However, the default behaviour (where the user sets nothing extra) should be reasonable for most Linux installations.
